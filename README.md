<h2>Wmanager</h2>
<p>Wmanager is a warehouse inventory management project that was made as final work for my bachelor studies.</p>
<br>
<p>This project is made using ASP.NET MVC and is using SQL database to store all necessary data.</p>
<h3>What Wmanager does?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Track number of items across the warehouses, saving description and number of items held</li>
  <li>Role based authentication for users, who are separated into 3 groups: admin, warehouse manager, worker</li>
  <li>Authentication is done using Identity framework</li>
  <li>Entities are persisted to underlying SQL database using Entity Framework.</li>
</ul>
